## Project Brief
Livestream Tools is a passion project aimed at making the job of content creators, especially live streamers, easier. It will offer a suite of services, including a song information pop-up (integrating previous prototypes), on-screen stream schedule widgets, and more. The goal is to provide customizable, user-friendly tools for streamers.

## Design
Design is a key focus, with an emphasis on responsive layouts for access on any device and a simple, foolproof user experience. Customization options will be available, with attention to making them easy to use and support.

## Development
The frontend is being built with React to deliver a single source for all chosen services, leveraging React's strengths for single-page applications. The backend is planned to use Node.js, with an API that interacts with various third-party services. The project also serves as an opportunity to expand experience with React.
