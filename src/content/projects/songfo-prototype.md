## Project Brief

One of my biggest passions is the video game industry and the streaming industry that has come from it. Songfo is a planned passion project to provide tools for content creators to use on their streams. This prototype demonstrates one of those tools: fetching and displaying the current song from Spotify.

## Design

As a prototype, the design focused on simplicity and user experience, making it easy for streamers to use without distractions. The interface was kept minimal to allow quick testing and feedback.

## Development

The backend was built with PHP to handle Spotify API authentication. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (primarily jQuery) for rapid development and testing. The prototype was shared with a small group of streamers for feedback and iteration.
